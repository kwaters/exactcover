"""Example pentominos solver.

Dana Scott studied covering a chessboard without the four center squares with
one of each of the twelve pentominos.  Scott used a novel backtracking approach
tuned to his exact problem.  Here we will use exact cover.

The universe consists of 72 elements.
  - One for each of the 12 pentominos.
  - One for each of the 60 non-center squares on the chess board.

Each subset represents one way to position one pentomino.  There are 1568 such
subsets.

There are 520 tilings (65 if we eliminate reflections and rotations).
