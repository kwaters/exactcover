"""Example Sudoku solver.

Sudoku can be easily solved by straight forward reduction to exact cover.
There are 364 elements in the universe.
  - One for each of the 81 cells, which must be occupied exactly once.
  - Nine for each of the 9 rows, which must contain every number exactly once.
  - Nine for each of the 9 columns, which must contain every number once.
  - Nine for each of the 9 boxes, which must contain every number once.
Each subset contains 4 elements, and represents one way to fill in a cell.
